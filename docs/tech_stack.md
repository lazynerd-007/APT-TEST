## Bias Mitigation Strategies in Automated Scoring

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

- **Diverse Training Data**: Ensure training data for scoring models includes diverse candidates across demographics, educational backgrounds, and experience levels.
- **Balanced Representation**: Audit training data to ensure balanced representation across different groups.
- **Anonymization**: Remove identifying information (names, gender pronouns, etc.) before scoring.
- **Consistent Preprocessing**: Apply the same preprocessing steps to all submissions regardless of candidate attributes.

### 2. Model Development and Evaluation

- **Fairness Metrics**: Incorporate fairness metrics during model training and evaluation:
  - Demographic parity
  - Equal opportunity
  - Equalized odds
  - Disparate impact analysis
- **Adversarial Debiasing**: Train models to be invariant to protected attributes.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Use ensemble models that combine different approaches to reduce individual biases.
- **Regularization Techniques**: Apply fairness-aware regularization during model training.
- **Explainable AI**: Use SHAP values or LIME to understand and address biased feature importance.

### 3. Scoring System Design

- **Multiple Assessment Types**: Combine different assessment types (coding, MCQ, situational judgment) to provide multiple paths to success.
- **Skill-Based Decomposition**: Break down scoring into specific skills rather than overall scores.
- **Customizable Weights**: Allow employers to adjust weights for different skills based on job requirements.
- **Contextual Scoring**: Consider the context of the solution rather than exact pattern matching.
- **Time-Adjusted Scoring**: Account for different approaches that may take more time but demonstrate deeper understanding.

### 4. Code Execution and Evaluation

- **Multiple Test Cases**: Use diverse test cases that cover various approaches.
- **Output-Based Evaluation**: Focus on correct outputs rather than specific implementations.
- **Algorithm Efficiency Tiers**: Create tiers of acceptable efficiency rather than strict time/space complexity requirements.
- **Language-Neutral Metrics**: Ensure scoring is fair across different programming languages.
- **Style-Agnostic Evaluation**: Avoid penalizing for stylistic differences that don't affect functionality.

### 5. Human Oversight and Continuous Improvement

- **Human Review**: Implement human review for edge cases or contested results.
- **Feedback Loops**: Collect feedback from candidates and employers to identify potential biases.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of scoring results across demographic groups.
- **A/B Testing**: Test scoring algorithm changes with A/B testing to measure impact on fairness.
- **Continuous Training**: Regularly retrain models with new, diverse data.

### 6. Transparency and Accountability

- **Scoring Transparency**: Provide clear explanations of how scores are calculated.
- **Confidence Metrics**: Include confidence scores with automated evaluations.
- **Appeal Process**: Implement a process for candidates to appeal automated scores.
- **Documentation**: Maintain thorough documentation of bias mitigation efforts.
- **External Validation**: Consider third-party validation of fairness metrics.

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: Bias-Aware Code Scoring

```python
# Using SHAP for explainable code scoring
import shap
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

def score_code_submission(code_features, model, explainer):
    """
    Score a code submission with bias awareness
    """
    # Get base score from model
    score = model.predict([code_features])[0]
    
    # Get SHAP values to explain the score
    shap_values = explainer.shap_values([code_features])
    
    # Check if any potentially biased features have high impact
    biased_feature_indices = [5, 8, 12]  # Example indices of potentially biased features
    bias_impact = np.sum(np.abs(shap_values[0][biased_feature_indices]))
    
    # Adjust score if bias impact is high
    if bias_impact > 0.3 * np.sum(np.abs(shap_values[0])):
        # Apply correction by reducing weight of biased features
        adjusted_score = model.predict([
            [v if i not in biased_feature_indices else v * 0.5 
             for i, v in enumerate(code_features)]
        ])[0]
        
        # Blend original and adjusted scores
        final_score = 0.7 * adjusted_score + 0.3 * score
        return final_score, True, bias_impact
    
    return score, False, bias_impact
```

            return showWarning[index] 
              ? '⚠️ Potential bias detected' 
              : '';
          }
        }
      }
    },
  };
  
  const data = {
    labels: demographicGroups,
